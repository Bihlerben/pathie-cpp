-- Version 0.1.0 (unreleased) --

* Switch license from GPL3 to BSD-2clause.
* Drop support for expanding "~username/foo" constructs. This
  nonstandard extension was unportable and caused problems when
  linking Pathie statically.
* Add Path::utf8_str() method.
* Restructure header #include order. Pathie now requires you
  to specify the exact header to include (e.g. <pathie/path.hpp>)
  instead of one global header. There was no point in having the
  stream replacements included if not required.
* Fix compilation problem with _PATHIE_UNIX not being defined
* Do not include <windows.h> in Pathie public headers. This caused
  problems in some circumstances when a certain macro combination
  of windows.h was needed.
* Remove config.hpp. This caused confusion when the library was used.
  Build configuration now only happens via comandline options.
* Drop shaky support for NTFS symlinks. It never worked really well
  anyway.

-- Version 0.0.3 (2015-04-30) --

* Don't use CMake's global configuration variables, allowing pathie to
  be built as a subproject.
* Fix compilation error on systems that do not automatically
  #include <stdexcept>.

-- Version 0.0.2 (2015-02-16) --

* Fix installation error on config.hpp
* Add message that C++11 is required for compilation

-- Version 0.0.1 (2015-02-13) --

First public release.
